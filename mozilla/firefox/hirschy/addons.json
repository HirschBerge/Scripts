If it is not possible then English will be the target language of the translation.\n\nIt's highly recommended to select less text than more, otherwise the translation will take longer to appear. You can select a maximum of 1100-character long text. If you select a longer text, you'll get an alert box in some cases. You shouldn't either select pictures or tables because these will disappear and mystic text will appear there.\n\nNow, let's see, how it works. Firstly, you search something that you don't understand because it's in an other language. Secondly, you select this section or sentence. Now you can go three ways:\n- Right-click with the mouse and click on \"Translate this text with Google Translate\" text.\n- Click on the Toolbar icon.\n- Press the hot-key.\nAs soon as the translation-progress starts, the Red T will become green, and as soon as the translation ends, it'd be red again. Within a second or two, you'll see that the selection disappears and a text in your language appears there. That's all.\n\nOr, if you want to translate the full page, you can go with the three ways mentioned above, too.\n\nOptions:\nyou can find this menu if you:\n- right-click on the Red T (or before Firefox 57 click on the little arrow next to it) and click \"Options\"\n- go to Add-ons menu and click on configuration of this addon\nyou can set here:\n- what language you want to translate to\n- what (and how) to translate when you click on the Red T or press the hot-key\n- the Hot-key (only before FF57)\nAvailable target languages: you can translate to every language that you can find on Google Translate page (http://translate.google.com/).

The following are the permissions required by this add-on:\n        tab and activeTab: Required to determine whether or not to display the action icons for the address bar and context menu each time a website is visited exclusively through the http and https protocols.\n        menus: Required to display context menu entries.\n        storage: Required to save locally the user options.\n    Extremely lightweight, relies on little known document.elementFromPoint browser's function to find elements that are in front with the highest z-index.\n    Non-intrusive. The extension activates only when you click its button, thereby it has no impact on navigation performance when you don't use the extension. Doesn't inject tons of CSS rules as AdBlock extension is doing for example.\n    Supports hiding of multiple DOM overlay elements.\n    Enables overflow auto of the body when overlay script hides it to disable the scroll of the page.","weeklyDownloads":19,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Iván Ruvalcaba","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13276911/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.35,"reviewCount":53,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/behind-the-overlay-revival/reviews/","updateDate":1555906810000},{"id":"{47bf427e-c83d-457d-9b3d-3db4118574bd}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2276/2276008-32.png?modified=e033a7a5","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2276/2276008-64.png?modified=e033a7a5","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2276/2276008-128.png?modified=e033a7a5"},"name":"nightTab","version":"7.3.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3848032/nighttab-7.3.0.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/zombieFox/nightTab","supportURL":"https://github.com/zombieFox/nightTab/","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nighttab/","description":"A neutral new tab page accented with a chosen colour.
